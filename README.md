## Assembly Instructions

### Phase 1: Layout and Mounting

1. **Prepare the base plate**
   - Lay out floor plate (minimum 36" wide with screen scrubber, 30" without)
   - Plan component placement before drilling any holes

2. **Position the battery**
   - Place battery in upper left corner (or right if mirror-flipping the layout)
   - **Important**: Battery must be as close to vehicle centerline as possible for stability

3. **Install RO membrane housing**
   - **Critical**: Insert RO membrane in the correct direction before mounting!
   - Add 1/2" John Guest fittings:
     - Input side: Fitting on outer hole, plug on center hole
     - Output side: Fittings on both holes
   - Position housing snug against battery to prevent jostling while moving
   - Secure with metal straps
   - **Tip**: If possible, orient input side as far from pump as possible (you want the shortest run between the permeate output port and DI input)

4. **Mount the pump**
   - Test fit vertical plate against battery (this creates a 4-sided restraint for the battery)
   - Position pump as high as possible so the fan fits underneath
   - Mark mounting holes using nail polish on bushing undersides (shows exact drill locations when removed)
   - Remove pump and drill mounting holes
   - Secure pump to vertical plate with mounting screws
   - Install slide ports in input/output holes

5. **Install cooling fan**
   - Mount directly below pump
   - Ensure adequate airflow underneath

### Phase 2: Filter Installation

6. **Sediment filter setup**
   - Mount 2.5x5" housing in easily accessible location (you'll be accessing it regularly)
   - The paper filter can be removed and washed nearly unlimited times
   - This catches all the large junk you don't want getting into the carbon canister
   - Thread push-to-connect fittings into both sides
   - Insert washable paper filter
   - Secure spin-on housing firmly to cap

7. **Carbon canister installation**
   - Add 90-degree fitting to input side
   - Position so output port points straight up
   - Add push-to-connect fitting to 90-degree fitting end
   - Mount cap with the provided white L plate (may need vertical support)
   - Add 1/2" fitting to output side

8. **Carbon canister drain modification**
   - **! Caution !**: This step requires careful drilling. If you do this wrong or rush you *will* crack the housing and you'll have to order a new one. If it feels like you're putting too much force on the canister when tapping the threads or they feel like they're going in crooked: you are.
     
   - Start with tiny pilot hole in bottom of housing
   - Gradually enlarge to 1/2"
   - Add threads using tap tool
   - Apply Gorilla Glue to threads
   - Install John Guest fitting

9. **Carbon filter insertion**
   - **Important**: Insert filter into cap first (seats on output port)
   - Slide housing over filter and tighten
   - (Prevents crushing filter if inserted into housing first)

10. **DI canister setup**
    - Fill with DI resin beads
    - Thread onto housing head
    - Mount however you want - it's orientation agnostic and will always purge its bubbles
    - Author's preference: Standing inverted above the rest of the system
    - Add John Guest fittings to both ports

### Phase 3: Plumbing Connections

11. **Install valves**
    - Add fittings to both sides of all Watts valves
    - Optional: Install 3rd valve for input control

12. **Main flow path**
    The whole system is 1/2" tubing and fittings from end-to-end
    - Input hose → Sediment filter input
    - Sediment output → Carbon input
    - Carbon output → Pump input (cut tubing slightly too long, don't connect yet - you'll connect after carbon flush)
    - ^^ Install locking clips on both sides of the pump ports or else it'll eventually blow off and shoot 5gpm of water into your car ask me how I know
    - Pump output → RO input
    - RO permeate → DI input
    - DI output → System output

14. **Waste circuit assembly**
    - RO concentrate → Very short section of tubing → One-way valve (prevents any backflow into RO)
    - One-way valve → Tee fitting
    - One tee branch → Bleed valve (allows you to slam waste valve closed during normal operation while maintaining proper minimum waste flow)
    - Install tee after bleed valve with bleed valve in middle position
    - Other original tee branch → Watts valve → Tee after the valve
    - Carbon drain → Few inches of LLDPE tubing → Watts valve → Continue to bleed valve tee → Through to watts valve tee
    - All waste streams now meet at single output
    - Add few inches LLDPE → 90-degree fitting → Waste line (any length) to atmosphere

### Phase 4: Electrical Connections

14. **Fan and pump wiring**
    - Strip and twist fan positive and fan interrupt wire
    - Connect twisted wires to pump positive in Wago nut (force 'em in there)
    - Connect fan negative and pump negative in separate Wago nut

15. **Battery connections**
    - Run negative wires to switch
    - Switch to battery negative (use ring terminals)
    - Install breaker near battery positive
    - Connect pump/fan positive to breaker input
    - Breaker output to battery positive (use ring terminals)
    - Install fused battery tender leads

### Battery Charging Warning
**Important**: When charging the system with an 8-amp charger, the battery tender leads get super hot and honestly kind of soft. Future revisions will include automatic fan activation during charging, but I haven't figured out how to do that yet without having a seperate switch which is a non-starter. For now, you can either:
- Accept that it hasn't caught fire yet and the leads can handle it (though they may deform over time)
- Use a lower amperage battery tender (but with a 200Ah battery, charging will take a really really long time)

## Initial Startup and Purging

### Critical First-Run Procedure

1. **Carbon filter flush** (Critical - prevents RO damage)
   - Turn on input and let carbon filter housing fill up
   - Spray carbon output water onto ground for minimum 15 minutes (or more)
   - When carbon filter is fresh, tons of carbon fines too small for you to see come out
   - These will clog up your RO and ruin it really quickly - this is an important step

2. **System filling**
   - Turn off water
   - Connect carbon output to pump input
   - Open RO waste valve fully
   - Turn water back on super gently - like a dribble (the slower you do it, the less bubbles you'll have to purge)
   - Fill system completely and let a fair few bubbles come out of the RO waste port
   - Stop input flow once filled

3. **Membrane conditioning**
   - Let filled system sit 2+ hours (optimally overnight)
   - Allows RO membrane and carbon filter to swell and saturate
   - You don't technically need to wait more than an hour, but it'll make the RO last months if not years longer

4. **Final purging**
   - After waiting, open input with RO waste still open
   - Purge for 5 minutes with pump off
   - Turn pump on and let it run wide open for another 20 minutes
   - You'll know it's fully purged when:
     - Carbon canister is full of water with no air pocket
     - You don't hear the crackle of air bubbles coming out of the waste port
     - Additionally though, you'll want to run it for a long time to wash out the preservatives that are in the RO when it is shipped dry

## Operating Procedures

### For Maximum Output Pressure
1. Run pump for 1-2 minutes with waste valve open
2. Turn pump off
3. Wait a few seconds
4. Close waste valve
5. Wait a few seconds
6. Turn pump on and begin production

This stepped startup shrinks/ejects air voids and maximizes system efficiency. You *would not believe* the reduction in output even a little bit of compressible air will produce. A fully bled system is a thing of beauty. The pump is nearly silent and the spray tips hiss so much water is coming out.

## Draining the System

### To drain:
1. **Carbon canister drain**
   - Either attach an extension to the carbon input tube or quickly swap it out with a hose that outputs lower than the rest of the system
   - Disconnect the pump input or the carbon output
   - This will rapidly drain the carbon canister
     - Obviously the output port needs to immediately go below the canister or it'll starve near the end of the drain

2. **RO membrane drain**
   - Open the waste valve with pump input disconnected
   - Turn the pump on
   - The incoming air will force the majority of water out through the RO waste
   - Let pump run for 45+ seconds until most water is expelled
   - Note: The pump can run dry for a surprising amount of time, and this method hasn't damaged my ROs so far (but your mileage may vary)

3. **DI canister drain**
   - Much slower due to built-in one-way valve
   - Pop off both input and output ports
   - Try to get a suction going on the input side
   - Sometimes you'll get lucky and it'll drain in 10 seconds, sometimes it takes 5 minutes to blub blub blub out.

## System Performance

With this setup, you'll have a system for less than $1,000 that blows commercial systems out of the water.

Good luck!

## Disclaimer

This guide is purely my DIY design that I'm releasing for free with no warranty and no guarantees. I'm no expert - I'm just a guy building a system in my garage. Build and use at your own risk. I cannot overstate to you, dear reader, how much I'm washing my hands of this guide. My system works well and I've accepted the risk of building a DIY system but that doesn't mean yours will be identical to mine or operate under the same conditions. Be smart about it and use critical thinking skills while building.

## Maintenance Schedule

- **Daily**: Literally nothing. Flip the switch and go.
- **Weekly**: Close RO waste and open Carbon waste to flush out accumulated biomass and fines
- **When the sediment filter looks nasty**: Unscrew the sediment filter and pour it out. Give the paper filter a rinse for good measure.
- **As needed**: Carbon filters are officially rated for 60,000 gallons but I don't trust like that. They're $15 so I replace them every couple months, RO should not need to be replaced for a LONG time if you flush it regularly, and DI beads need to be replaced when your TDS gets above 7-10 or when you start to see spots.

## Troubleshooting

- **Low pressure**: Check for air in system or perhaps the battery has a low charge
- **High TDS**: Replace DI resin or check RO membrane (RO output should be about 10ppm)
- **Leaks**: Check all push-to-connect fittings

## Safety Notes

- Always use circuit breaker for pump protection
- Secure battery properly to prevent movement
- Consider bolting the unit to the floor of your vehicle. In the event of a rollover that 400lb brick will absolutely kill you
- Never run pump dry
- Monitor TDS regularly for water quality
- Heat shrink terminals and be smart about placing electrical connectors
- Don't leave the system sitting out in the sun for days at a time because, at least in the American South, it'll grow green biofilm.
